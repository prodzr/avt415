            <h3>Best Practices for The Mobile-First Approach</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Prioritize Page Content </dt>
                <br>
                <dd>When it comes to mobile-first design, designers must bear in mind the fact that content is the key. As <br> there are space restrictions on smaller screens, web designers must ensure that the most critical <br> elements are prominently displayed since those are the ones users will actively look for. </dd>
                <br>

                <dt>2. Deliver Intuitive Navigation</dt>
                <br>
                <dd>Intuitive navigation is of utmost importance when it comes to delivering a neat and clean user <br> experience on mobile devices. Web designers can leverage features like navigation drawers (using <br> Hamburger menus) to display secondary elements of the website. This will help users to find the <br> necessary information easily. </dd>
                <br>

                <dt>3. Avoid Disruptive Pop-ups </dt>
                <br>
                <dd>As mentioned frequently, mobile devices have space constraints and no user likes to be accosted with <br> sudden pop-ups or advertisements taking over the screen. Website owners or designers must only <br> focus on whatâ€™s important for users and provide them with the things they are looking for in the first <br> place. </dd>
                <br>

                <dt>4. Test on Real Devices Under Real Conditions</dt>
                <br>
                <dd>The most effective way of ensuring that a website delivers optimal user experiences across devices is <br> by testing them on real devices. This helps designers verify whether the website renders as expected <br> across mobiles, tablets, and desktops. </dd>
